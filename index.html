          Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength
          of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the
          tranquility of the High Sierra.

          First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
          waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find
          deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness
          area, and much more.

          Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire
          carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This
          blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for
          <strong>current fire restrictions.</strong>

          We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping,
          and backpacking. You can pay the
          <b>park entrance fee</b> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in
          advance).
